##Introduction
This app is a code challenge for the 2017 Social Tables Apprentice Program. The app is in React/Redux and is a canvas app with multiple tools and features.

##Installation
1. Fork repo (optional)
2. Clone repo
3. Run 'npm install'
4. Run 'npm start' - this will run the app in development mode
5. Open localhost:3000 to render locally

##What's working
1. All components are created as required in the challenge guidelines
2. Reset, Brush Color, Save, and Eraser
3. Styling has been updated to closely resemble challenge mockup

##What's not working
Currently, the image stamp feature is not fully functional. The image needs to be passed to the canvas when the STAMP tool is selected. Also, the image upload button needs styled.

##Answers to ST questions
1. What aspect of your submission are you most proud of, and why?
  - I am proud of the whole app but was really proud when I was able to implement the image uploader. This was a feature I hadn't handled before but found a great resource online that showed how this could be done.
2. What would you work on if you had more time?  
  - REDUX! While I understand benefits of Redux, what it accomplishes, and some of its fundamentals principles, I would like to work more on writing and implementation.
3. Of all the resources (blog posts, tutorials, videos, mentors, etc.) you referenced, what was most helpful for you?
  - I had two things that were most helpful - pair programming and leveraging a mentor. I think these being able to work with another dev and/or know when to ask for help are vital for any junior developer.
